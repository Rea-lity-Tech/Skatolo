### Skatolo is a GUI library for Processing, forked from [ControlP5](https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5)

## Why a fork ?

ControlP5 is an old but still maintained library.  We wanted to develop new
features for it such as multi-touch support or support in Ruby, to do so
understanding the code and upgrading to our coding standards required some work.

## What is the difference ?

This library is for an **advanced** use of ControlP5, it is not as convenient to
use. It is a part of a research and development project involving multi-touch,
augmented reality and Ruby.

### Please use the original library in your projects if you are not sure which one to use.

## Why Skatolo ?

Skatolo means “box” in [esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto).
The main purpose of is this for is to develop a GUI library for multi-touch and
special inputs, and for [JRubyArt](https://github.com/ruby-processing/JRubyArt).
As ControlP5 is a very convenient and good library, it was natural to use it as
a base.
